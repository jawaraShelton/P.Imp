"# P.Imp" 

P.Imp (P.hoto Imp.orter) is intended to be a bare-bones, command-line utility 
designed to import photos from my camera's memory card and organize them into 
folders according to the date the image was shot.

The name P.Imp is not only a product of its diminutive length, but also intended
as a nod to the character Tyrion Lannister from "Game of Thrones".
