# P.Imp

**P**hoto **Imp**orter (P.Imp) is intended to be a bare-bones, command-line utility 
designed to import photos from a camera's memory card and organize them into 
folders according to the date the image was shot.

The name P.Imp is a product of its acronym, overall diminutive length, and a quiet  
nod to the character Tyrion Lannister from "Game of Thrones"--just because.
